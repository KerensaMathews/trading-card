			<p class="main-description">Sea turtles have been on Earth since the Late Jurassic period (about 150 million years ago). They grow larger than land turtles, and cannot retract their head and appendages into their shell. They are omnivorous; common meals include seaweed, worms, and fish. Can often be found hanging around coral reefs.</p>
