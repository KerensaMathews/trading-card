# trading-cards
This is a simple trading card template built with HTML5 and CSS3. 

## Project History

This was an early Udacity project. We were instructed to build a sample card for a hypothetical animal trading card game, using only HTML and CSS. I chose a sea turtle as my example card topic.

## User Information

This project contains four files: an HTML index file, a CSS stylesheet, an image file, and this README file. All project files are rooted in the main project folder. (If this were a larger project, images and CSS stylesheets would have their own subfolders.) To open and view the trading card, download the project files and open the index.html file in your browser. 

## Thoughts for Expansion

It would be a fun challenge to turn this into an educational game with interactivity. It could be biology-themed like this one, but could also focus on a different branch of science, history events, geography facts, math tables, or anything else of interest. Using a database would streamline data entry, significantly speeding up creation, maintenance, and updating of cards and card information, making this project more efficient and dynamic as a whole.
